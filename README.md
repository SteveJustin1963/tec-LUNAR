TEC-1 Forth controlled 3D Lunar Lander Simulator on 3D moon.


The following code is a basic example of how to land a lunar lander on the moon:

1. Set up the lander in the correct position for landing.

2. Make sure that all the safety checks are complete and that the lander is ready for landing.

3. Start the engines and begin the descent.

4. Monitor the lander's progress and make any necessary course corrections.

5. Touch down lightly on the surface of the moon.

6. Shut down the engines and complete the landing procedure.
